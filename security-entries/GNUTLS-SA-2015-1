    <td>Signature forgery</td>
    <td>This issue only affects versions of GnuTLS prior to 3.1.0 (released in 2012).
    These versions don't verify the RSA PKCS #1 signature algorithm to
    match the signature algorithm in the certificate, leading to a potential
    downgrade to a disallowed algorithm, such as MD5, without detecting it.<br>

      <b>Recommendation:</b> Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.1.0, or later.
A patch will be included in gnutls_2_12_x branch for the users of that
version that cannot upgrade.</td>
